# IzPCSC

IzPCSC is a C++ library and CLI tool designed to facilitate smart card and NFC communication. It provides an easy-to-use interface for reading and writing data to smart cards, as well as supporting the EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) protocol. With IzPCSC, developers can quickly integrate smart card functionality into their applications and perform operations such as card detection, data exchange, and protocol-specific tasks.
